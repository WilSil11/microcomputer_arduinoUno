# Microcomputer Programs

### _Welcome to the project main repository!_
This repository is comprised of code in assembly and C languages for projects completed with Arduino UNO R3 in Ubuntu 16.04.5 LTS environment.

**Please Note: This repository is work in progress! Changes can and _will_ occur! This code and documentation is a demonstration of personal projects.**

## Directory Descriptions:

**asm folder**
1. **led_togg:** _The Arduino UNO is interfaced an LED to toggle the output on Digital Output 13._
2. **serial_port:** _PORTB and PORTD are used in series for input/output configuration._
3. **timer:** _Using compare and match concept with bit masking to set and toggle the value of PORTB._
4. **delay:** _Delay using 2-bit I/O configuration._

**C language folder**
1. **led:** _Blink the LED on (Digital Output 13) every second, in C language._
2. **motor_angle** _Using PWM (Pulse Width Modulation), the microcomputer will read voltage (from 0 to 5 V) to rotate to maximum and minimum angle on servo motor._
